# state_zipcode_json

Zipcode polygons for each state using ZLIB compression. Yes, polygons do not strictly define zip codes but they are good enough for many applications.

I took the data from here: https://github.com/OpenDataDE/State-zip-code-GeoJSON and used ZLIB compression on the coordinates to make it 70% smaller.
